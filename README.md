# Bebop Drone with YOLOv8 Object Detection

This project integrates the Parrot Bebop drone with YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and autonomous navigation. The drone analyzes video frames, detects objects, and adjusts its movement based on the object's position.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for detecting objects in real-time.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The drone moves according to the position of detected objects.
- **Supports Input**: Processes images and videos for detection and analysis.
